            Taekwondo origionally called Subak is a self defence martial art that was developed in the 1940's. It has
            many techniques that date back as far as 2000 years ago. It origionated in Korea. Due to it's
            defensive style it gained popularity quickly spreading to other countries.</div>
        <div class="box box2">
            Taekwondo can be practiced in two different ways. It can either be practiced traditionally, where you
            learn different blocks and kicks as you progress through the belts. The second practice is a more
            fighting
            based
            approach. In this style you enlist in tournaments and fight against people in your age and weight
            class. Both practices provide various benefits to the students and it is their choice, for how they want
            to
            train. The <a href="https://google.com">National Taekwondo Federation</a> is the company that runs most
            national
            tournaments.</div>
        <div class="box box3">There are 5 main tenets that all students must follow. They are Courtesy,
            Integrity,
            Perseverance, Self-Control and Indomitable spirit. All students follow these tenets not only in the
            school
            but also outside the school. Many of these values are used everyday by a lot of people but all
            Taekwondo
            students practice these tenets everyday.</div>
